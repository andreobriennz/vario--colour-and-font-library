# Vario Colour and Font Library (Alpha)

## What is it?
A basic boilerplate and library of fonts and colours we're creating as a bit of a side project. Primarily intended for use on smaller projects, letting us get started more quickly. Based on SCSS. 

*Project is still in Alpha and will likely change a lot*

Using with Normalize is recommended.

## Componients
- Boilerplate

## Removed componients 
- Cards
- Menus 
- Buttons 
- Grid (redesigned in seperate project, although we tend to use Skeleton nowadays)

## Needs reivew
